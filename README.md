Off line emulation of the Mume world for safe exploration.

This project has been merged into [my TinTin scripts repository](https://github.com/nstockton/tintin-mume "TinTin-Mume"). Please use the startemulation.py script in TinTin-Mume to virtually explore the Mume world. This repository is now deprecated, and has been left up here for historical reference only.
